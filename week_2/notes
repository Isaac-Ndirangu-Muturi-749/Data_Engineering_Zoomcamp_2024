HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you
define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable
configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then
use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your
infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.


Why Terraform?

Simplicity in keeping track of infrastructure
Easier collaboration
Reproducibility
Ensure resources are removed
